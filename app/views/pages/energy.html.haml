  %h1 Energy Services
  %p Energy services from a telecom broker? Yes! The two fields are actually very similar when you live in a deregulated state.   Similar to telecom there is the distributor owns the last mile delivery infrastructure.  You can get you services directly from them or you can go to competing companies to shop the rates. 
  %p How it works: If you buy your energy directly from the distributor they just give you the default rates for that current time period and adjust the cost according to your usage.  In this environment you are usually paying a much higher rate than is necessary.  Competitive energy companies can buy the energy for you at typically a lower cost.  They analyze your usage over your last 12 month period and calculate how much energy you need in a 12 month period.   They can then go to the market and purchase what you need at a certain rate and then provide that to the distributor.  What this means to you is your per kilowatt rate can be much lower, saving you money.
  %p All energy companies are the same right? Incorrect some companies just sell you a low rate for your energy.  If you look a little deeper you can find companies that not only lower your rate but also look for ways to reduce the energy that you need.  There are programs out there that can actually earn you money to help reduce your cost!  This is good for your bottom line but also helps the environment.  You can pat yourself on the back twice being a hero to your company for lowering cost and saving the earth at the same……look at you.
  %p The process is simple give us a copy of your current contract and last energy invoice and we will do the rest for you.  The best part is there is no installation process! The billing information is simply adjusted.
